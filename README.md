# INFO-F-308

## Purpose

This git repository intends to summarize the work on the article *Uncovering disease-disease relationships
through the incomplete intneractome* from J. Menche et al.

As a 3rd year student in computer sciences at Belgian university *Université Libre de Bruxelles*, one of the
projects I have been assigned to is the following: work on the previously cited article with Pr. Tom Lenaerts
in order to reproduce the obtained results and upgrade it to the new versions of the used databases.

## Hierarchy

The repository is for now organized as follows:

+ `source/` contains all the python source both provided with the article and produced by myself.
+ `data/` contains the provided data and their newer versions.
+ `report/` contains the report on the produced content and the conclusions of it.
